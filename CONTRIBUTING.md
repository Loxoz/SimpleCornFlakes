# Contributing Guide to SimpleCornFlakes

Any kind of contribution matters! Whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Submitting a Fix
- Proposing new features
- Or even becoming a maintainer

## We develop with github

We use Github to host, share and sync our code, to track issues and for it's beautiful PR System that allows us to propose pieces of code.

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue]().

Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce.

Here's how you should construct your issue:

- Issue Description
- Versions
- Expected Behavior
- Actual Behavior
- Samples / Steps to reproduce

## Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests.

- Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`. (e.g. `dev`)
- If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
- If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
- Make sure `npm test` passes, as well as `npm lint`.
- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - GitHub will automatically squash it before merging.
- Finally, open a Pull Request from that branch with well-indepth explanations of what has been changed/added/removed.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
